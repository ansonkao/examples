# Minimal Drag-and-Drop Example

This is an adapted version of the [Revideo](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo) [NextJS SaaS template](https://github.com/redotvideo/examples/saas-template), demonstrating how you can build drag-and-drop editing functionality with Revideo.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies both in the next/ and the revideo/ directories:

```bash
(cd next && npm install) &&
(cd revideo && npm install)
```

Then, serve the Revideo project using the CLI:

```bash
(cd revideo && npx revideo serve)
```

Now you can start your NextJS app using the following command:

```bash
(cd next && npm run dev)
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result. Happy developing!
